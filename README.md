# Ants

When we think of dynamics, systems like springs and masses, gravitational
bodies, attractors, and other mechanical phenomena come to mind.  An
emergent theme among these topics is the formation of complex, chaotic behavior
from simple mechanical underpinnings. Ants seeks to explore this behavior in a
more familiar environment: an ant farm.  Through simple behavioral and
social constraints, Ants provides a mechanical foundation to foster chaotic
interactions. What beautiful patterns will these creatures create? How will
these ants function together to achieve their common goal? Throughout their
interactions, I hope to provide a pleasing visual experience from which to view
these: Ants.
